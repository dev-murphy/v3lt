# My Vue 3 template

I just got tired of the constantly setting up a Vue 3, because I am just "that guy".

## Features

There are some features/packages I have usually in every Vue 3 project that I do, which I've listed below.

> [!NOTE]
> In this project, I am using Vite Vue template, PNPM package manager and Typscript as my defaults. You can always change the package manager easily

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite) - for UI framework
- [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/getting-started.html) - for state management
- [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/installation.html) with [unplugin vue router](https://github.com/posva/unplugin-vue-router?tab=readme-ov-file#install) - for file-based routing for single page web apps
- [Unplugin Auto Import](https://github.com/unplugin/unplugin-auto-import?tab=readme-ov-file#install) - for auto-importing vue directives
- [Unplugin Vue Components](https://github.com/unplugin/unplugin-vue-components?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) - for auto-importing vue components
- [VueUse](https://vueuse.org/guide/) `Maybe` - for additional features

## Shout out

A big shoutout goes to [@Antfu](https://github.com/antfu), as this template is heavily inspired by this own, [Vitesse](https://github.com/antfu-collective/vitesse). So yea, I love the work you've done :heart:.
